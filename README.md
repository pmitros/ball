SGI OpenInventor Ball Racing Game
=================================

This is a game I wrote in the late nineties or early 2000's. You race
a ball along a 3d track. It's based on a simple (but very fun) HP48 3D
racing game. No clue if it still compiles or works.

I later made a nicer version of this game in VHDL.
